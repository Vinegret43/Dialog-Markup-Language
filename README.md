# Dialog Markup Language

Dialog Markup Language lets you create non-linear dialogues in your games/apps/etc.
using Python. It has its own syntax which goal is to make dialog files more
readable and editable.

#### Features:
1. Simple and readable syntax
2. Multiple tools for creating branching and non-linearity
3. Compiling dialogues so that they will work faster on runtime

#### Drawbacks:
1. This is written with Python, while most game developers use C++ or C#
2. Some bugs and unmade features because development started just now
